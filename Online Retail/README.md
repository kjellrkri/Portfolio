![banner](https://github.com/kjellrkri/Portfolio/blob/main/Online%20Retail/online_retail_cluster_analysis_banner.png)
## Overview
This project aims to perform clustering analysis on the Online Retail dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains transnational data for a UK-based online retail company, including all transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. The company specializes in selling unique all-occasion gifts, and many of its customers are wholesalers.

## Dataset Source
The dataset was sourced from:
- **Author**: Daqing Chen
- **Year**: 2015
- **Title**: Online Retail
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)
- **DOI**: [10.24432/C5BW33](https://doi.org/10.24432/C5BW33)

## Additional Information
- This is a transnational dataset containing all the transactions for a UK-based online retail company.
- The transactions span from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011.
- The company specializes in selling unique all-occasion gifts.
- Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are as follows:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data to prepare it for clustering analysis.
3. Apply various clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
4. Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithms and interpret the results.
5. Derive actionable insights and recommendations for the online retail company based on the clustering analysis.

## Usage
- The main script for conducting the clustering analysis is provided in the Jupyter Notebook file `online_retail_clustering_analysis.ipynb`.
- Ensure all required libraries are installed before running the notebook.
- Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook to execute the code blocks sequentially.
- Input the appropriate file paths or URLs when loading the dataset.
- Explore the results and visualizations generated during the analysis to understand the customer segmentation.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## Conclusion
